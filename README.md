# Python/Flask todo with Docker

A simple todo application development environment using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Requirements

Support for Docker Compose version 3 (latest Docker Compose recommended)

_More may come..._

## Instructions

### Linux

```bash
# Go to repository folder
docker-compose up
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` when its finished loading.

To run in detached mode simply add the flag -d to the end of the command.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Windows

Same as Linux.

If you run into an error while running docker-compose up, open the settings of Docker for Windows (right click icon in taskbar and select settings). Then go to Network tab and select Fixed DNS Server with the adress 8.8.8.8 (should be prefilled already). Apply and wait for docker to restart. Try docker-compose up again.

You also require a password in order to share files with docker, for some reason Docker can't handle a user without a password so if you don't have one, you should add a password to your profile.

### MacOS

Needed?

## Clean up

Instruction to clean up containers and images.

_**WARNING**_ Removes _all_ containers, images and volumes!

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -f dangling=true -q)
```
